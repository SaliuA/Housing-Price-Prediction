# Introduction:
The real estate market is complex and dynamic, with numerous factors influencing the prices of homes. Understanding these factors and accurately predicting house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors. Our House Price Prediction Model is designed to provide reliable price estimates for homes based on a comprehensive set of features.

### Problem Statement:
Accurately predicting house prices is a critical challenge in the real estate market, influenced by a multitude of factors including dwelling types, zoning classifications, lot features, property conditions, and sale conditions. Traditional methods of property valuation often rely on limited data and subjective assessments, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This creates uncertainty for various stakeholders such as home buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors, potentially resulting in financial losses and inefficient market operations..

### Objective:
To address these challenges, our goal is to develop a robust House Price Prediction Model that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze a comprehensive set of property features and market data with an accuracy target of 85%. This model aims to provide accurate, data-driven price predictions that can be used by various stakeholders to make informed decisions in the real estate market.

### Data Sources:

The data for this project will be sourced from the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset on Kaggle.
